# README file of capstone_data_science repository:
The capstone project for Data Science specialization - Coursera

This repository contains the files of the Milestone Report for the Coursera Data Science Capstone final project and the My GuessApp application for prediction the next word to be typed in a sentence.

The goal of the capstone project is to explore the most important features of a text data set offered by Johns Hopkins University within this capstone project of the Data Science Specialization in partnership with Swiftkey.

As a result of this exploration, we have to create a predictive text model using a large text corpus of different type of documents as training data, like blogs, news, twitter. We will perform an exploratory data analysis over this corpus of text data and will use common natural language processing techniques to build a predictive model by the final of this capstone project.

This predictive model is to be implemented in a final application using the R’s Shiny package that will predict the next word to be typed using a natural language processing model. We will have to make certain transformations over the text data corpus before building the predictive model, i.e. removing unnecessary noises, such as certain kinds of characters and words (stopwords, offensive words), html links, tags, punctuations, symbol and digits in order to aid in prediction accuracy of the model. As a result with all these transformation we will end up with several list of tokens - some lists containing single words and also two, three and four word phrases that occur most frequently in our test data set of text corpus.

This data set consist of text in different languages like Russian, German, Finnish and English. We will be using the English set and will load the files inside the “en_US” folder which contains three text files sourced from blogs, news and twitter feeds: “en_US.blogs.txt”, “en_US.news.txt” and “en_US.twitter.txt”.
